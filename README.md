# GhostSweeper
GhostSweeper is a Java game written for Android over the space of six days (project 2 from CodeClan's 16-week software development course). I based the game logic on the classic Minesweeper - the player navigates the board as they uncover the tiles and try to trap all evil spirits lurking in the shadows. My MVP was to create a simple playable game with a clickable board containing hidden ghosts and number-based hints indicating how many ghosts are in direct vicinity. Beyond that, I managed to implement 'traps' enabling the player to capture ghosts (you can't place more traps on the board than there are ghosts) and three difficulty levels.  

## Learning objectives
- build a complete app in Android Studio,
- practice creating multiple activities and recyclable views (e.g. GridView),
- understand Activity lifecycle and callbacks for navigating transitions (onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy()),
- practice stroing app data in Shared Preferences,
- be able to use recursion in a function,
- use SOLID design practices to write flexible and maintainable code,
- gain a better understanding of the four pillars of OOP (abstractian, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism)

## The app can be downloaded from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.e20.ewa.ghostsweeper">Google Play Store</a>. Reviews and feedback very welcome!
